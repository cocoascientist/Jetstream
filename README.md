Jetstream
====

iPhone app for showing current weather conditions, using the [OpenWeatherMap API](http://openweathermap.org/api). The app is written in Swift with an MVVM architecture. The networking layer is mostly inspired from [Tiny Networking](http://chris.eidhof.nl/posts/tiny-networking-in-swift.html) and the functional concepts from [LlamaKit](http://chris.eidhof.nl/posts/tiny-networking-in-swift.html).
